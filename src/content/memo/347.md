The information provided highlights the use of fake timers in both Vitest and Jest, two popular JavaScript testing frameworks, and how they use the `@sinonjs/fake-timers` package to manipulate the system date and time. Here's a summary and comparison of the two frameworks' approaches to using fake timers:

### Vitest

Vitest allows you to control and manipulate the system date and time during tests using the `@sinonjs/fake-timers` package. This is useful for testing time-dependent code, like ensuring a function behaves correctly at different times of the day. The typical approach in Vitest involves:

- **Using Fake Timers**: This is done by calling `vi.useFakeTimers()` in the `beforeEach` hook, which ensures that the fake timers are used in every test.
- **Restoring Real Timers**: After each test, `vi.useRealTimers()` is called in the `afterEach` hook to revert the system back to real time.
- **Setting System Time**: During the test, you can set the system time to a specific date or time using `vi.setSystemTime(new Date(...))`.

Example:

```javascript
describe('purchasing flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.useFakeTimers()
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    vi.useRealTimers()
  })

  it('allows purchases within business hours', () => {
    vi.setSystemTime(new Date(2000, 1, 1, 13))
    expect(purchase()).toEqual({ message: 'Success' })
  })

  it('disallows purchases outside of business hours', () => {
    vi.setSystemTime(new Date(2000, 1, 1, 19))
    expect(purchase()).toEqual({ message: 'Error' })
  })
})
```

### Jest

Jest also integrates with the `@sinonjs/fake-timers` package, starting with version 26. The key differences and features in Jest include:

- **Legacy vs Modern Fake Timers**: Jest 26 introduced a new "modern" implementation of fake timers based on `@sinonjs/fake-timers`. This new implementation offers additional features like mocking `Date`, `queueMicrotask`, and more.
- **Opting into Modern Fake Timers**: In Jest 26, the modern timers are opt-in and can be activated using `jest.useFakeTimers('modern')`. This allows developers to transition to the new implementation gradually. By Jest 27, the modern timers become the default.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Jest continues to support the legacy implementation, which can be enabled using `jest.useFakeTimers('legacy')`.

Example of using modern fake timers in Jest:

```javascript
describe('purchasing flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.useFakeTimers('modern')
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.useRealTimers()
  })

  it('allows purchases within business hours', () => {
    jest.setSystemTime(new Date(2000, 1, 1, 13))
    expect(purchase()).toEqual({ message: 'Success' })
  })

  it('disallows purchases outside of business hours', () => {
    jest.setSystemTime(new Date(2000, 1, 1, 19))
    expect(purchase()).toEqual({ message: 'Error' })
  })
})
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Consistency Across Tests**: Both Vitest and Jest ensure that your tests run consistently by allowing you to manipulate the system time.
- **Opt-in Modern Implementation in Jest**: Jest's modern implementation of fake timers must be explicitly enabled in Jest 26, but it will become the default in Jest 27.
- **Use Cases**: These techniques are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to simulate different times of day or specific dates to test time-sensitive logic.

By using these tools, you can simulate different times and dates, ensuring that your code behaves as expected under various conditions.
